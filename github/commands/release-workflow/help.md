Release a stuck workflow lock for a GitHub issue.

This is an operator recovery command. It does not touch the bead or the pull
request; it only clears the intake-side workflow lock so `/gc fix` can be
accepted again for the same issue.

Example:
  gc github release-workflow owner/repo 42

Arguments:
  <repository>    owner/repo
  <issue_number>  GitHub issue number

Flags:
  --command <name>  slash command to unlock, default: fix
  --force           release even if the previous bead already posted GitHub side effects
