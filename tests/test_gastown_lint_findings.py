"""Hold `gc lint gastown` at a pinned finding set.

gastown is a supported pack. It is exercised by supported-pack-nightly.yml and
it is NOT in the `gc lint` loop in .github/workflows/ci.yml, which is how it
accumulated fourteen findings that nothing failed on: nine prompt templates and
formulas telling agents to run bd flags that do not exist, and five pack-level
diagnostics.

Seven of those were real and are fixed. The rest are defects in gc's own
linter, enumerated with their gc-side cause in
`tests/gastown_lint_upstream_defects.txt`.

A NEW finding fails, which is the regression this exists to catch. A pinned
finding that DISAPPEARS also fails, because that is the upstream fix landing
and the waiver should be deleted in the same change rather than quietly
outliving it.

Which findings gc emits depends on which gc ran, and this test does not paper
over that. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs `gc@latest`; twenty-two findings
that a released gc reports were fixed on gascity main by 7724983de and are
absent from a dev build. So the waiver file is sectioned: entries every gc
reports are required, and a version-dependent section is tolerated but has to
be wholly present or wholly absent. That is what the sections are for, and it
is why the first run of this test in CI went red while it was green locally.

Fidelity, and where it stops: this runs the real `gc lint` against the real
pack, so it is not a fixture reimplementation of the linter and it cannot drift
from it. What it cannot do is check a flag `gc lint` does not know about --
internal/bdflags/bdflags.go carries a manifest of bd subcommands, and anything
outside that manifest is skipped by design. It is also line-oriented and does
not join backslash-continued shell lines, so the three multi-line `gc bd create
... \\ --labels=warrant` invocations fixed alongside this test were never
reported by it at all. A green here means "no NEW finding of a kind gc lint can
see", not "every bead command in the pack is valid".
