# GC Decompose

Use this skill after `gc.plan` and `gc.design` have approved artifacts. This is
a planning and task-creation skill: it may write `tasks.md` and create convoys
and runnable beads, but it must not implement those beads.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the target rig/root path, plan slug, and artifact root. Default to:
   `<rig-root>/.gc/plans/<plan-slug>/`.
2. Read `requirements.md` and `design.md`. Refuse to proceed unless both are
   `approved`, unless the user explicitly overrides that gate.
3. Inspect the target codebase enough to validate task boundaries,
   dependencies, file ownership, and test strategy.
4. Draft `tasks.md` with a human-readable task plan and a machine-readable YAML
   payload under `## Bead Creation Payload`.
5. Interview the user one question at a time until the task plan is approved.
6. When approved, update `status: approved`, run the bead creation script in
   dry-run mode, then run it for real if dry-run passes.
7. After creation, ensure `tasks.md` records `status: created` and the
   `## Created Beads` mapping for both convoy heads and runnable beads.

## Artifact

`tasks.md` must begin with YAML front matter:

````yaml
---
plan_slug: example-slug
phase: tasks
rig: backend
rig_root: /absolute/path/to/rig
artifact_root: /absolute/path/to/rig/.gc/plans
requirements_file: /absolute/path/to/requirements.md
design_file: /absolute/path/to/design.md
status: draft

```
````

Use nested `convoys[]` for arbitrary groupings. Do not emit `epics[]`. A convoy
is a bead-backed grouping object, not a blocking dependency mechanism; express
blocking relationships against runnable children when they are precise.
`convoys[].dependencies` is allowed as shorthand only when the downstream roots
should depend on the upstream terminal runnable beads. Dependencies use local
keys; the script resolves them to bead IDs.

## Bead Creation

Use the pack script:

```bash
python3 <pack-root>/assets/scripts/create_beads_from_tasks.py <artifact-root>/<plan-slug>/tasks.md --dry-run
python3 <pack-root>/assets/scripts/create_beads_from_tasks.py <artifact-root>/<plan-slug>/tasks.md
```

If needed, pass an explicit city:

```bash
python3 <pack-root>/assets/scripts/create_beads_from_tasks.py tasks.md --city /path/to/city
```
